# Domain Task 4 Report — Remediation B Completion

Domain Task 4 is **complete for its identity and access-request scope**.
`nazo-postgres` owns identity/access-request PostgreSQL schema, private
persistence records, conversions, repositories, and the atomic access-request
approval transaction. Server production source no longer defines or directly
queries identity or `client_access_requests` persistence. The auth-owned admin
grant repository remains explicitly bound to Task 5; access requests no longer
depend on `GrantProjection` or `GrantPage`.

## Final architecture

- `nazo-postgres` owns the pool, embedded migration constructor, private Diesel
  schema, private persistence records, record-to-domain conversions, and
  concrete user/MFA/passkey/federation/SCIM repositories.
- The catch-all `IdentityUser` API is deleted. Password authentication loads
  `AuthenticationIdentity`, composed from `Principal`, `LoginIdentity`,
  `AccountIdentity`, and `PasswordHash`. Session/profile/admin/SCIM callers load
  the password-free `PublicAccount`; OIDC userinfo and ID-token paths load
  `Principal` plus `SubjectClaims` directly. Focused Diesel selections prevent
  public-account and claims reads from retrieving `password_hash`.
- `PasswordHash` owns a private string, rejects blank persisted values, has a
  redacted custom `Debug`, implements neither `Serialize` nor `Deserialize`,
  and exposes verifier bytes only through `expose_for_verification()`. The
  exposure occurs inside the bounded blocking password verifier.
- Server registration, profile, avatar, admin-user, session, token, MFA
  enrollment/verification, passkey, federation, and SCIM callers consume
  repository/domain results instead of identity Diesel records.
- MFA enrollment confirmation updates the TOTP credential, user MFA state, and
  replacement backup hashes transactionally. Backup consumption, TOTP
  anti-replay CAS, remembered-device operations, passkey counter updates,
  federation link resolution/creation, and SCIM lifecycle mutations are owned
  by focused postgres repositories.
- Revoked refresh tokens are never substituted with a successor. Rotation and
  replay mutation acquire the same stable PostgreSQL advisory transaction lock
  for the token family. Replay marking and family revocation are one database
  transaction; concurrent use produces one HTTP 200 and one `invalid_grant`,
  after which the family has no active refresh token. The HTTP winner does not
  guarantee that its returned refresh token remains valid after family
  compromise. Inactive linked federation users, including social identities
  without email, receive the compatible `401 access_denied` response.
- Admin role/level PATCH reads under a row lock, validates the final typed
  combination, performs one update, and converts before commit. Passkey counter
  writes use expected-counter CAS and monotonic validation while retaining the
  WebAuthn `0 -> 0` counterless-authenticator case. Concurrent first-time
  federation provisioning re-reads the unique link after a conflict.
- An empty admin user PATCH is a baseline-compatible no-op: it returns the
  current representation without mutating `updated_at`.
- Migration `20260712000050_social_federation_provider_type` permits the
  production `oauth2_social` provider type while preserving existing OIDC/SAML
  rows. Its down migration fails while social links exist; operators must
  migrate or remove those links explicitly before rollback. Timestamp
  `20260712000100` remains available for the planned runtime desired-state
  migration.
- Subject-claim conversion uses the same persisted-user invariant as principal
  conversion. Backup-code input and candidate scans share the explicit maximum
  of 10, enrollment unique violations map to `Conflict`, and focused joins bind
  user/client tenant IDs as defense in depth.
- Access-request list/detail/create/cancel/reject/approve operations are
  tenant-scoped `AccessRequestRepository` methods returning identity-domain
  `AccessRequest` values, not adapter projections. Approval locks a pending
  request, creates the OAuth client, and performs the tenant/status/actor CAS in
  one PostgreSQL transaction. A losing concurrent approval rolls back its
  client insert. `server/src/support/access_requests.rs` and server access
  request row/status types are deleted.
- Valkey delivery retains the compatible fail-closed ordering: the one-time
  delivery record is written before the PostgreSQL approval transaction; a DB
  failure or CAS loss compensates by deleting that request-specific key. A
  delivery write failure does not call the repository and commits neither a
  client nor an approval. This is explicitly a compensated cross-system flow,
  not a distributed transaction.
- `GrantRepository`, `GrantProjection`, `GrantPage`, and admin grant revoke are
  auth-owned work deferred to Task 5. They are not used by access-request code.
- `crates/server/src/schema.rs` contains no production identity table
  definitions, identity joinables, or identity allow-to-appear entries.
  Database-oriented in-source tests retain an explicitly `#[cfg(test)]`
  fixture schema at
  `crates/server/tests/in_source/src/domain/identity_schema.rs`; production code
  cannot import it and it is not public API.
- Server still depends on Diesel for auth/runtime tables that are outside Task
  4. Removing that dependency belongs to their later ownership migration.

## Structural contract

`server_has_no_identity_rows_or_identity_diesel_queries` recursively scans
`crates/server/src` and rejects:

- former identity persistence record names;
- exact identity schema table tokens used by Diesel queries;
- production identity `table!` definitions.

The `http::admin::users` Rust module re-export is explicitly distinguished from
the `users::` Diesel schema token. The contract first failed on the residual
access-request joins, admin-grant join, refresh active-user lookup, and six
production identity schema definitions. It passes after 4B2.

Remediation B extends the contract to reject `client_access_requests::`,
`UserAccessRequestRow`, `PendingAccessRequestRow`, and
`AccessRequestProjection` in server production source. It also verifies that
both handlers contain no Diesel token, the forwarding support file is absent,
and fail-closed delivery precedes repository approval.

## Verification

- `rtk proxy cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  - exit 0.
- `rtk proxy cargo test -p nazo-identity -p nazo-postgres -p nazo-oauth-server --lib --all-features --locked`
  - exit 0; server: 1654 passed, 0 failed; postgres: 3 passed, 0 failed;
    identity: 0 tests.
- `rtk proxy cargo test -p nazo-postgres --all-features --locked -- --nocapture`
  - with the migrated PostgreSQL service: exit 0; 3 repository unit tests, 13
    identity integration/contract tests, 1 migration up/down test, and 2
    compile-fail privacy doctests passed.
- `cargo test -p nazo-postgres --doc --all-features --locked`
  - exit 0; 2 compile-fail privacy tests passed with `E0603` for private
    `schema` and `rows` modules.
- `rtk proxy cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked`
  - exit 0.
- `rtk proxy cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings`
  - exit 0.
- `cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked`
  - exit 0 with `NAZO_TEST_DATABASE_URL` pointing at the disposable migrated
    PostgreSQL database; no test failures.
- `rtk proxy cargo doc -p nazo-postgres --no-deps --all-features --locked`
  - exit 0.
- Public-item scan of `target/doc/nazo_postgres/all.html`
  - no private schema module or persistence record is listed. The crate index
    intentionally contains compile-fail examples naming private `schema` and
    `rows` paths; those examples prove the paths are inaccessible and are not
    API leaks.

Remediation B verification:

- Password-leak RED test first failed because derived `Debug` contained the
  complete Argon2 verifier; after encapsulation, identity/postgres focused tests
  passed and three identity compile-fail doctests proved the secret is not
  serializable/deserializable.
- `cargo test -p nazo-postgres --test access_requests --all-features --locked -- --nocapture`
  - exit 0 against `127.0.0.1:15433/oauth`; 3 tests passed, covering
    create/list/cancel, tenant and owner isolation, concurrent approve/reject
    CAS, and losing-client rollback.
- `cargo test -p nazo-oauth-server --lib access_requests::tests:: --all-features --locked -- --nocapture`
  - exit 0 with real PostgreSQL and Valkey; 29 tests passed, including rollback
    after client insert, duplicate transitions, and ACL-induced delivery write
    failure with the request left pending and no client committed.
- `cargo test -p nazo-identity -p nazo-postgres -p nazo-oauth-server --lib --all-features --locked`
  - exit 0 with mandatory PostgreSQL configured and optional server live-service
    variables unset; 1,660 tests passed.
- `cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked`
  - exit 0 with only `NAZO_TEST_DATABASE_URL` configured; 2,047 tests passed in
    37 suites.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, workspace all-target/all-feature check, and
  strict workspace Clippy with `-D warnings` all exited 0.
- `cargo doc -p nazo-identity -p nazo-auth -p nazo-postgres --no-deps --all-features --locked`
  and identity doctests exited 0. Public postgres docs expose no access-request
  adapter projection or persistence record. The existing grant projections are
  recorded above as Task 5 scope.

Windows emitted the existing localized MSVC `linker stdout` warning while
linking the server test binary; it did not fail compilation or tests.

## Database verification

Remediation A used the migrated isolated services at
`127.0.0.1:15433/oauth` and `127.0.0.1:16384/0`. The postgres integration
suite executed against the real database rather than returning through its
environment gate. With `CI=true`, omitting both database URLs was separately
verified to fail explicitly instead of silently skipping.

Focused real-service server tests covered refresh replay, inactive federation,
SCIM zero-count cursor behavior, admin partial updates, passkey authentication,
and MFA flows. A full server run with both live service variables enabled was
not used as the final aggregate gate because the pre-existing
`oidc_callback_creates_new_federated_user_session_and_external_link` local
one-shot HTTP fixture waited beyond 60 seconds; the repository concurrency test
itself completed in 0.11 seconds and showed no database deadlock. The final
exact/workspace aggregate gates used `NAZO_TEST_DATABASE_URL` for mandatory
postgres tests while leaving optional server integration variables unset.

The follow-up re-ran the no-email social completion regression and the three
refresh-family/admin exact tests against the real services. Each completed in
under 0.1 seconds. A broad `inactive_linked_user` filter was explicitly not
counted as passing: two unrelated one-shot HTTP fixtures ran concurrently and
waited indefinitely. The new no-email regression avoids that invalid signal by
testing the production callback-completion boundary with a resolved
`SocialIdentity`, a real PostgreSQL external link, a real Valkey client, and a
five-second deadline.

Run the real database slice with:

```powershell
$env:NAZO_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://.../nazo_test'
rtk proxy cargo test -p nazo-postgres --test identity_repositories -- --nocapture
```
