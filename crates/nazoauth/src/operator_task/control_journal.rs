//! Application operation journal for signed [`ControlOperation`]s (E03,
//! NazoAuthCtl-goal-plan/05 §4/§5).
//!
//! Core invariants:
//!
//! ```text
//! same operation_id + same request_hash
//!     => one operation lifetime; side effects run at most once
//! same operation_id + different request_hash
//!     => permanent OPERATION_ID_CONFLICT
//! ```
//!
//! The accepted record (including the authorization snapshot:
//! `controller_id`, `kid`, `accepted_at`, `request_hash`) is durably
//! persisted *before* any side effect starts, and the terminal
//! [`ControlResult`] is durably persisted *before* the caller outputs
//! success.  Crash recovery therefore never replays a mutation and never
//! loses a completed outcome.
//!
//! # Storage medium
//!
//! One JSON record per operation id under
//! `<operator-state>/control-journal/{operation_id}.journal.json`,
//! published with the same audited durability pattern as the operator task
//! lifecycle: `create_new` temporary + `sync_all` + `hard_link` (or
//! `rename`) + directory sync, all under the exclusive operator task lock.
//! A database table was deliberately rejected: `migrate-apply` legitimately
//! runs before any database exists, so accept-time persistence must not
//! depend on DB connectivity, and the one-shot operator process already owns
//! this state directory.
//!
//! # Phase model
//!
//! `accepted -> executing -> completed`, monotonically.  `accepted` is the
//! pre-side-effect checkpoint; `executing` means the business action may
//! have started or finished without a durable result; `completed` carries
//! the final result.  A restarted process may cross `accepted -> executing`
//! freely, may re-enter `executing` only when the operation class has a
//! proven-idempotent state owner (`resume_allowed`, E05 decides per
//! operation), and otherwise fails closed with
//! [`JournalFlowError::UnknownOutcome`] instead of guessing.
//!
//! Torn publication windows (temporary file present, final missing or
//! stale) are recovered monotonically: a fully written temporary whose
//! phase is greater than or equal to the published record is adopted;
//! anything else fails closed and leaves the files untouched.
//!
//! # Retention
//!
//! [`cleanup_completed_before`] deletes only `completed` records whose
//! result age exceeds the cutoff.  `accepted`/`executing` records are never
//! deleted automatically: deleting them would either revoke a still
//! resumable authorization or fabricate evidence that an authorized
//! operation never happened.  Their count is bounded by the operational
//! fact that each one represents an unresolved incident an operator must
//! resolve (or decommission with the deployment state directory).
//!
//! # Test failpoints
//!
//! The flow calls the injected `pause` hook at exactly these points so
//! process-level tests (once E04 wires the binary entry) and unit tests can
//! kill/restart at every boundary:
//!
//! ```text
//! control-journal-before-accept
//! control-journal-after-accept
//! control-journal-before-side-effect
//! control-journal-after-side-effect
//! control-journal-before-result   (result not yet durable)
//! control-journal-after-result    (result durable, caller output pending)
//! ```
