# OpenID Connect Integration

This document is the entry point for integrating a relying party with this
OpenID Connect Provider. It is a project-specific integration reference: it
describes the implemented protocol surfaces, the capabilities intentionally not
implemented, and the deployment flags that affect metadata.

Use `https://issuer.example` only as a placeholder in this document. Every
deployment and every conformance run must use its own public HTTPS issuer.

Status terms are literal. **Complete** means the capability is implemented for
the stated role/profile and is advertised only when its enablement conditions
are true. **Not implemented** means no runtime flag, client metadata field, or
hidden compatibility path enables that capability. When a row says
**not supported** for a standards-defined optional value, the reference explains
the syntax and security model, while discovery and registration metadata are the
executable allowlist. A standards-defined optional value is not automatically a
claim that the value is safe or implemented here.

## Discoverable endpoints

Relying parties should read endpoints from discovery. A baseline deployment can
expose the following endpoints when the matching modules are enabled:

| Endpoint | Path | Advertisement rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OIDC discovery | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` | Always present for OIDC deployments. |
| OAuth authorization-server metadata | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | Present for OAuth/OIDC deployments. |
| Protected resource metadata | `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` | Present for resource-server metadata. |
| FAPI resource metadata | `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/fapi/resource` | Present for the FAPI resource surface. |
| JWKS | `/jwks.json` | Publishes active non-retired signing keys and previous keys still in use. |
| Authorization | `/authorize` | Supports code-flow authorization requests. |
| PAR | `/par` | Advertised/required according to profile and client policy. |
| Token | `/token` | Handles supported grant types and client authentication methods. |
| UserInfo | `/userinfo` | Requires an access token with `openid` scope. |
| Introspection | `/introspect` | For protected resource validation and profile-specific protected responses. |
| Revocation | `/revoke` | For refresh/access token revocation where applicable. |
| Logout | `/logout` | RP-Initiated Logout with exact registered redirect URI validation. |
| Dynamic registration | `/register` | Advertised only when `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION=true`. |
| Device authorization | `/device_authorization` | Advertised only when `ENABLE_DEVICE_AUTHORIZATION_GRANT=true`. |

Discovery metadata must be treated as authoritative. If a field is absent, the
deployment is not claiming that capability.

## Minimum supported integration

New integrations should use Authorization Code Flow with S256 PKCE.

| Field | Recommended value |
| --- | --- |
| Issuer | `https://issuer.example` |
| Discovery | `https://issuer.example/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| JWKS | `https://issuer.example/jwks.json` |
| Authorization endpoint | `https://issuer.example/authorize` |
| Token endpoint | `https://issuer.example/token` |
| UserInfo endpoint | `https://issuer.example/userinfo` |
| Logout endpoint | `https://issuer.example/logout` |
| Response type | `code` |
| Response mode | `query`; `form_post` when the client and RP both require it |
| PKCE | `S256` |
| Scopes | Start with `openid`; add only the claims the RP actually needs |
| Client authentication | Public clients use `none` with PKCE; confidential clients should use `private_key_jwt`, mTLS, or `client_secret_basic` according to their risk profile |

The relying party should discover endpoints from metadata instead of hardcoding
paths. Hardcoded paths are shown only to make the integration shape explicit.

## Client registration

The provider supports two client onboarding models:

1. Static administrative registration.
2. RFC 7591 / RFC 7592 Dynamic Client Registration when
   `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION=true`.

Dynamic registration is disabled by default and should be protected by an initial
access token in public deployments. A dynamically registered client receives a
`registration_client_uri` and a registration access token for its own
management lifecycle.

Accepted client metadata includes the usual OIDC/OAuth fields:

| Metadata | Status | References | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `client_name` | Supported | [RFC 7591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html), [OpenID Connect Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) | Display metadata; login UI reads authoritative server-side registration data. |
| `redirect_uris` | Required for authorization-code clients | [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html), [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) | Exact matching. |
| `post_logout_redirect_uris` | Supported | [RP-Initiated Logout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html) | Exact matching for logout. |
| `response_types` | `["code"]` | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) | Implicit and hybrid values are rejected. |
| `grant_types` | Per-client allowlist | [RFC 7591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html) | Must match implemented grants and client policy. |
| `scope` | Per-client allowlist | [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html), [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) | Requests cannot widen beyond registration. |
| `token_endpoint_auth_method` | Supported methods listed below | [RFC 7591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html), [OpenID Connect Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) | FAPI profiles narrow the acceptable set. |
| `jwks` | Supported | [RFC 7517](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517.html) | Used for client signing, encryption, and self-signed mTLS certificate material. |
| `jwks_uri` | Supported under constrained remote-document policy | [RFC 7591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html), [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) | Only safe HTTPS sources accepted by policy. |
| `request_uris` | Supported under constrained baseline policy | [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) | Exact HTTPS registration; FAPI profiles prefer PAR. |
| `userinfo_signed_response_alg` | Supported | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) | The selected algorithm must be advertised and backed by an active key. |
| `userinfo_encrypted_response_alg` / `userinfo_encrypted_response_enc` | Supported with valid client encryption key | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 7516](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html) | Uses the narrow JWE policy below. |
| `authorization_signed_response_alg` | Supported for JARM-capable clients/profiles | [JARM](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-jarm.html) | Must be executable by the active keyset. |
| `authorization_encrypted_response_alg` / `authorization_encrypted_response_enc` | Supported for nested encrypted JARM | [JARM](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-jarm.html), [RFC 7516](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html) | Requires a valid client encryption key. |
| `initiate_login_uri` | Supported; HTTPS only | [Third-Party Initiated Login](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-3rd-party-initiated-login.html) | OP-side metadata for RP-initiated login initiation. |
| `software_statement` | Not implemented | [RFC 7591 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html#section-2) | RFC 7591 defines software statements as signed client metadata from a trusted statement issuer. No software-statement issuer, trust anchor, or verification policy is configured or advertised. |

Recommended baseline registration metadata:

```json
{
  "client_name": "Example Application",
  "redirect_uris": ["https://app.example/oauth/callback"],
  "response_types": ["code"],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "scope": "openid profile email",
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic"
}
```

For public browser, native, or SPA clients:

```json
{
  "client_name": "Example Public Application",
  "redirect_uris": ["https://app.example/oauth/callback"],
  "response_types": ["code"],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
  "scope": "openid profile email",
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none"
}
```

Public clients must send S256 PKCE. Baseline confidential OIDC code-flow
compatibility may accept a request without PKCE, but new integrations should
still send PKCE. FAPI, sender-constrained, public, and non-OIDC authorization
code clients must use S256 PKCE.

## Request, scope, and resource boundaries

The server applies subset rules at every step that can widen authority:

- a token request cannot widen the scopes or resource indicators granted by an
  authorization request;
- a refresh request cannot exceed the grant's stored scope/resource boundary;
- a client cannot request scopes or resources outside its current registration;
- resource indicators use RFC 8707 repeated `resource` parameters;
- the legacy OAuth `audience` parameter is not accepted for authorization or
  token requests outside the explicit Token Exchange profile.

Use the smallest scope set the application needs. Start with `openid`, then add
`profile`, `email`, `phone`, or API-specific scopes only when the RP consumes
those claims or resources.

Common OIDC scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `openid` | Required for OIDC authentication and ID Token issuance. |
| `profile` | Enables standard profile claims when policy permits them. |
| `email` | Enables email claims when policy permits them. |
| `phone` | Enables phone claims when policy permits them. |
| `offline_access` | Enables refresh-token issuance only when the client and consent policy allow it. |

## ID Token, UserInfo, and access token audiences

The ID Token is for the relying party. Its `aud` identifies the client that
requested authentication.

Access tokens are for resource servers. A relying party should not infer access
token semantics from the ID Token. If a resource server needs to validate access
tokens, use the resource-server verifier guidance or introspection endpoint
appropriate for that deployment.

UserInfo requires an access token with `openid` scope. Per-client signed or
encrypted UserInfo can be configured when the client has registered the required
metadata and keys.

## Algorithms and request objects

The server advertises only algorithms that the active runtime keyset can execute.

Current integration rules:

- ID Token, UserInfo, JARM, and Request Object algorithms must be selected from
  discovery metadata and client registration policy;
- unsigned Request Objects (`alg=none`) are not supported;
- signed Request Objects use asymmetric algorithms and registered client keys;
- external `request_uri` is available only as a constrained baseline feature for
  exact HTTPS URIs registered through authenticated dynamic registration;
- FAPI profiles continue to use server-issued PAR request URIs instead of
  client-hosted `request_uri` documents;
- ID Token signing defaults should be read from discovery, not assumed by the
  RP.

For high-assurance clients, prefer PAR, signed Request Objects, JARM, DPoP, or
mTLS according to the selected profile.

Do not configure a relying party to require an algorithm that the current
discovery document does not advertise. Metadata truth is a hard contract in
this implementation: advertised algorithms must be executable, and unadvertised algorithms
must not be assumed.

The JOSE tables intentionally separate two cases: algorithms excluded by a
security boundary, and optional JOSE algorithms that are standards-defined but
not advertised by the current metadata. For optional unadvertised algorithms,
the cited RFC is the syntax reference, not a statement that the RFC forbids that
algorithm.

### JWT signing algorithms

The following table summarizes the JOSE signing algorithms supported
for OIDC/OAuth client-configurable surfaces. A deployment may advertise a subset
when the active keyset or runtime profile is narrower.

| Algorithm | Key type | Hashing algorithm | Use | Status / surfaces | References | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EdDSA` | Ed25519 | EdDSA | `sig` | Supported for Request Objects, client assertions, UserInfo, JARM, introspection/revocation response JWTs where the surface is enabled | [RFC 8037](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8037.html), [RFC 7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html) | Requires an active Ed25519 signing key or registered client Ed25519 public key, depending on direction. |

Request Objects must be signed or signed and encrypted. |

### Request Object algorithms

Request Objects are accepted only when the client and runtime policy allow that
request path.

| Algorithm | Key type | Hashing algorithm | Use | Status / condition | References | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EdDSA` | Ed25519 | EdDSA | `sig` | Accepted with registered client JWK or resolved `jwks_uri` key using `use=sig` and `alg=EdDSA` | [RFC 8037](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8037.html), [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) | Supported for signed Request Objects and client assertions. |
| `RS256` | RSA | SHA-256 | `sig` | Accepted with registered client JWK or resolved `jwks_uri` key using `use=sig` and `alg=RS256` | [RFC 7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html), [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) | Baseline interoperability option. |
| `ES256` | ECDSA P-256 | SHA-256 | `sig` | Accepted with registered client JWK or resolved `jwks_uri` key using `use=sig` and `alg=ES256` | [RFC 7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html), [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) | Supported asymmetric option. |
| `PS256` | RSA-PSS | SHA-256 | `sig` | Accepted with registered client JWK or resolved `jwks_uri` key using `use=sig` and `alg=PS256` | [RFC 7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html), [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) | High-assurance/FAPI-compatible option. |
| `none` | None | None | N/A | Not accepted | [RFC 9101 Section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html#section-4), [RFC 8725 Section 3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html#section-3.1) | Rejected because signed Request Objects are required for protected request-object surfaces; expected OIDF skips for unsigned modules are bounded and explicit. |
| `HS*`, `RS384`, `RS512`, `ES384`, `ES512`, `PS384`, `PS512` | Various | Various | `sig` | Not accepted | [RFC 7518](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html), [RFC 8725 Section 3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html#section-3.1), [RFC 9101 Section 6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html#section-6.1) | Standards-defined JOSE algorithms, but not advertised for Request Objects. Request Object validation uses a strict per-client algorithm allowlist. |

External `request_uri` is not a general internet fetch feature. It is accepted
only for exact HTTPS URIs that were registered through authenticated client
metadata and that pass the deployment's remote-document safety policy. FAPI
profiles continue to prefer PAR and server-issued request URIs.

### JWE encryption algorithms

The provider deliberately exposes a narrow JWE set for client-encrypted UserInfo,
encrypted JARM, and other client-bound response JWT surfaces.

Key management algorithms:

| Algorithm | Key type | Use | Status / JWK condition | References | Notes |

## Response types and response modes

Supported interactive response type:

| Name | Status | Value | References | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization Code | Supported | `code` | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) | The only interactive OIDC response type. Public clients, FAPI clients, sender-constrained clients, and non-OIDC code-flow clients must use S256 PKCE. |
| Implicit ID Token | Not implemented | `id_token` | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2) | Excluded because it relies on front-channel ID Token delivery. |
| Implicit Access Token | Not implemented | `token` | [RFC 6749 Section 4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.2), [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2) | Excluded because the implicit grant is deprecated by the OAuth Security BCP. |
| Implicit ID Token + Access Token | Not implemented | `id_token token` | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2) | Excluded because it depends on implicit front-channel token delivery. |
| Hybrid Code + ID Token | Not implemented | `code id_token` | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2) | OIDC Core defines the value, but it sends an ID Token through the browser front channel before token-endpoint exchange. That preserves the same exposure class RFC 9700 moves away from for implicit-style responses. |
| Hybrid Code + Token | Not implemented | `code token` | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2) | OIDC Core defines the value, but it returns an access token through the browser front channel. RFC 9700 deprecates this exposure pattern. |
| Hybrid Code + ID Token + Token | Not implemented | `code id_token token` | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2) | Combines both front-channel ID Token and access-token delivery with code flow; the supported interactive profile keeps those tokens behind the back-channel token endpoint. |

Supported response modes for baseline OIDC:

| Name | Status | Value | References | Conditions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Query String | Supported | `query` | [OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-multiple-response-types-1_0.html) | Baseline code flow and profiles that allow plain authorization responses | Default mode for `response_type=code` when no stricter profile applies. |
| OAuth 2.0 Form Post | Supported | `form_post` | [OAuth 2.0 Form Post Response Mode](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-form-post-response-mode-1_0.html) | Baseline code flow; not available for FAPI profiles that require stricter response policy | Returns a no-store, CSP-protected auto-submit HTML form to the registered redirect URI. |
| JARM | Supported | `jwt` | [JARM](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-jarm.html) | JARM module/profile/client metadata enabled | Signed authorization response JWT; may be nested JWE when client encryption metadata is valid. |
| Form Post JARM | Not supported | `form_post.jwt` | [JARM](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-jarm.html) | N/A | Standards-defined response mode, but not advertised; use `jwt` for JARM or `form_post` for plain code form-post. |
| Query JARM | Not supported | `query.jwt` | [JARM](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-jarm.html) | N/A | Standards-defined response mode, but not advertised as a distinct response mode. |
| Fragment JARM | Not supported | `fragment.jwt` | [JARM](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-jarm.html) | N/A | Standards-defined response mode, but not advertised. |
| Fragment | Not implemented | `fragment` | [OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-multiple-response-types-1_0.html), [RFC 9700](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html) | N/A | Front-channel token delivery is not implemented. |

`form_post` does not enable implicit or hybrid token delivery. It is only a
browser transport for supported authorization responses.

## Grant types

| Grant type | Status | References | Advertisement / enablement rule | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authorization_code` | Supported | [RFC 6749 Section 4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.1), [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) | Client grant allowlist includes it | Primary OIDC login grant. |
| `refresh_token` | Supported | [RFC 6749 Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-6) | Client policy, consent, and grant allow it | Never returned from implicit/front-channel flows. |
| `client_credentials` | Supported | [RFC 6749 Section 4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.4) | Client grant allowlist includes it | OAuth resource access only; not an OIDC login flow. |
| `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` | Supported | [RFC 8628](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8628.html) | Device Authorization Grant module enabled and client allowlist includes it | Disabled deployments do not claim this grant. |
| OpenID CIBA grant | Supported | [OpenID CIBA Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html) | CIBA module enabled and client registered for poll or ping delivery | Push delivery mode is not implemented. |
| `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` | Supported | [RFC 7523](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html) | Client grant allowlist includes it | JWT bearer grant for bounded resource access. |
| `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` | Supported | [RFC 8693](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html) | Explicit bounded local profile/client policy | Not a generic arbitrary delegation mechanism. |
| `password` | Not implemented | [RFC 6749 Section 4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.3), [RFC 9700 Section 2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.4) | N/A | RFC 9700 says this grant MUST NOT be used. |
| `implicit` | Not implemented | [RFC 6749 Section 4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.2), [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2) | N/A | OAuth Security BCP deprecates implicit front-channel token delivery. |

## Client authentication

| Method | Status | References | Client type / conditions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | Supported | [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html), [RFC 7636](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636.html) | Public clients only; S256 PKCE required | Not allowed for confidential-client grants. |
| `client_secret_basic` | Supported | [RFC 6749 Section 2.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-2.3.1), [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) | Confidential clients with stored secret | Baseline shared-secret method. |
| `client_secret_post` | Supported, compatibility only | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 9700](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html) | Confidential clients with stored secret; excluded by FAPI profiles | Prefer `client_secret_basic`, `private_key_jwt`, or mTLS. |
| `client_secret_jwt` | Not supported | [OpenID Connect Core Section 9](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication), [RFC 9700 Section 2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.5) | N/A | Standards-defined for confidential clients, but not advertised. JWT client assertions use `private_key_jwt`; high-assurance clients should use asymmetric or sender-constrained authentication. |
| `private_key_jwt` | Supported | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 7523](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html) | Client has a valid registered signing key | Supported signing algorithms are `EdDSA`, `RS256`, `ES256`, and `PS256`; high-assurance profiles may narrow this set. |
| `tls_client_auth` | Supported | [RFC 8705](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html) | Trusted mTLS/proxy boundary configured; client metadata binds certificate subject/SAN/hash | Advertised only when deployment mTLS support is active. |
| `self_signed_tls_client_auth` | Supported | [RFC 8705](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html) | Trusted mTLS/proxy boundary configured; client has registered self-signed certificate material | Advertised only when deployment mTLS support is active. |
| `attest_jwt_client_auth` | Supported | [OAuth Client Attestation draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth/) | Client-attestation module enabled and client policy requires it | Disabled deployments do not claim this client authentication method. |

High-assurance integrations should prefer asymmetric or sender-constrained
client authentication. FAPI profiles exclude shared-secret POST authentication.

For `private_key_jwt`, use the issuer or token endpoint audience accepted by
the deployment profile and keep assertion lifetimes short. For mTLS, register
the correct certificate-bound client metadata and make sure the deployment's
trusted proxy/mTLS termination boundary is configured before advertising mTLS
metadata.

## Logout and sessions

The provider supports RP-Initiated Logout at `/logout` and validates registered
`post_logout_redirect_uri` values exactly. Logout integrations should use
metadata discovery and register all post-logout redirect URIs explicitly.

Front-channel and session-management behavior is profile-tested in the OIDF
matrix. Browser-sensitive logout/session flows should be tested separately from
high-concurrency authorization matrices because they depend on shared browser
state.

## Third-party initiated login

The provider supports the OP-side metadata required for OpenID Connect
Third-Party-Initiated Login:

- `initiate_login_uri` can be registered through dynamic client metadata;
- the URI must be HTTPS;
- non-HTTPS metadata is rejected.

This profile does not add an OP-side initiation endpoint. The initiation URI is
an RP endpoint; the RP uses it to start a normal authorization request against
the provider.

## Dynamic registration is not legacy Dynamic OP

The provider implements secure RFC 7591 / RFC 7592 dynamic client registration, but
does not implement the legacy OIDF Dynamic OP certification profile. That
profile requires discovery metadata for implicit and hybrid flows, which are
excluded by RFC 9700 and the OAuth 2.1 direction described below.

Use this terminology precisely:

- "Dynamic Client Registration" means disabled-by-default RFC 7591 / RFC 7592 client
  lifecycle support.
- "Dynamic OP certification profile" is not supported.

## Specification-backed non-implementation boundaries

The following decisions are not project-local preferences. They are derived
from current IETF / OpenID security guidance and are encoded as product
boundaries.

| Capability | Status | Normative or current security source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Implicit grant and implicit OIDC response types | Not implemented | [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2), [OAuth 2.1 draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/) | OAuth Security BCP deprecates implicit because browser front-channel token delivery has weaker leakage and replay properties than code flow with PKCE. |
| Hybrid response types | Not implemented | [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [RFC 9700 Section 2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.1.2) | OIDC Core defines Hybrid Flow, but it exposes ID Tokens and/or access tokens through the browser front channel before the token endpoint. RFC 9700 deprecates implicit front-channel token delivery; the supported interactive profile remains authorization code with PKCE/sender constraints where required. |
| Resource Owner Password Credentials | Not implemented | [RFC 9700 Section 2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#section-2.4), [OAuth 2.1 draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/) | OAuth Security BCP states that the password grant MUST NOT be used because it exposes user credentials to clients and does not compose with modern MFA/passkey authentication. |
| Unsigned Request Objects (`alg=none`) | Not implemented | [RFC 9101 Section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html#section-4), [RFC 8725 Section 3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html#section-3.1) | Protected request-object surfaces require signed Request Objects; JWT BCP requires applications to allow only algorithms that meet the application's security requirements. |
| Query-string bearer tokens | Not implemented | [RFC 6750 Section 2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html#section-2.3), [RFC 9700](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html) | RFC 6750 documents the query method but says it is not recommended because URLs are commonly logged and leaked. |
| CIBA push mode | Not implemented | [OpenID CIBA Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html), [FAPI-CIBA](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-ciba.html) | The implemented and tested FAPI-CIBA support surface is poll and ping; push would introduce direct token delivery to the client callback and is outside the supported profile set. |

## Security boundaries

The following are intentionally not supported for new integrations:

- implicit grant;
- OIDC Implicit OP;
- OIDC Hybrid OP;
- Resource Owner Password Credentials grant;
- unsigned Request Objects;
- query-string bearer tokens;
- FAPI form-body bearer tokens;
- CIBA push mode.

These are specification-backed product boundaries, not missing configuration
switches. Do not attempt to enable them with hidden deployment options.

## Metadata truth and deployment flags

Several capabilities are controlled by runtime modules or profile settings. The
server must not advertise disabled or incomplete behavior.

| Capability | Required deployment state before advertising |
| --- | --- |
| Dynamic Client Registration | `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION=true`; public deployments should configure an initial access token. |
| Device Authorization Grant | `ENABLE_DEVICE_AUTHORIZATION_GRANT=true` and client grant allowlist includes device code. |
| CIBA | `ENABLE_CIBA=true` and registered CIBA clients with allowed delivery mode. |
| mTLS client authentication / sender constraints | Trusted mTLS/proxy boundary configured and client metadata registered. |
| FAPI profiles | `AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_PROFILE` and client policy must enforce PAR, sender constraints, strong client authentication, and PKCE where applicable. |
| UserInfo/JARM encryption | Client metadata includes valid encryption preferences and exactly one usable public key for the selected algorithm. |
| OpenID4VCI / OpenID4VP | Corresponding runtime module enabled, credential/trust configuration complete, and public metadata generated from that configuration. |

## Integration checklist

Before putting a relying party into production:

1. Configure the client with a public HTTPS redirect URI.
2. Use `response_type=code`.
3. Send S256 PKCE, including for confidential clients.
4. Request only required scopes.
5. Discover endpoints from `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
6. Validate ID Token `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `nonce` when used, and
   signature.
7. Do not treat the ID Token as an API access token.
8. Register post-logout redirect URIs exactly when logout is used.
9. Use `private_key_jwt`, mTLS, DPoP, PAR, or JARM for higher-risk clients.
10. Re-check discovery metadata after changing runtime profile flags.
