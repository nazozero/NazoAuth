# OpenID4VC Final conformance matrix

NazoAuth implements the **Credential Issuer** role from OpenID for Verifiable
Credential Issuance 1.0 Final and the **Verifier** role from OpenID for
Verifiable Presentations 1.0 Final. It does not implement or advertise a Wallet
role.

The implementation is split into four protocol boundaries:

- `nazo-digital-credentials`: DCQL, SD-JWT VC, ISO mdoc, JOSE/COSE and trust ports.
- `nazo-openid4vci`: issuer metadata, offers, proof validation contracts,
  immediate/batch/deferred issuance, nonces and notifications.
- `nazo-openid4vp`: verifier request policy, transaction state and DCQL-bound
  presentation verification.
- `nazo-openid4vc-http-actix`: HTTP transport and management adapters only.

Persistence, key management, subject data and HTTP are adapters behind those
domain ports. Tests live under each crate's `tests/` directory; static CI
rejects test code in the production source trees.

## Supported final boundary

The issuer supports `dc+sd-jwt` and `mso_mdoc`, authorization-code and
pre-authorized-code grants, wallet- and issuer-initiated flows, credential
offers by value or reference, S256/DPoP and client-attestation HAIP paths,
one-time proof nonces, JWT and key-attestation proofs, immediate and deferred
issuance, batch issuance, notifications, signed metadata, and ECDH-ES/A256GCM
credential request/response encryption with optional `DEF` compression.

The verifier supports DCQL for `dc+sd-jwt` and `mso_mdoc`, `redirect_uri`,
`x509_san_dns`, and `x509_hash` Client Identifier Prefixes,
`direct_post`/`direct_post.jwt`, URL-query and signed request-URI retrieval
(GET and POST), encrypted responses with per-transaction keys, transaction
data, SD-JWT KB-JWT verification, and the final OpenID4VP mdoc session
transcript. HAIP is restricted to `x509_hash`, a signed request URI, and
`direct_post.jwt`.

Unsupported optional mechanisms are not advertised: Wallet behavior,
Digital Credentials API transport, DID client identifiers, verifier
attestation client identifiers, and unbound mdoc credentials.

## Signing-key boundary

OpenID4VC signing uses an ES256 local key scoped only to `credential` and
`presentation_request`. It is generated through the existing atomic key store:

```text
nazo-oauth-keyctl generate-local --alg ES256 --purposes credential,presentation_request
```

The persisted `purposes` field is fail-closed. A purpose-scoped key is excluded
from OIDC rotation and cannot sign access tokens, ID Tokens, JARM, logout
tokens, HTTP messages or security events. The configured OpenID4VC leaf
certificate must match this exact scoped key and chain to the configured trust
anchors; startup fails otherwise. Operators must not edit `keyset.json`
manually.

## OIDF suite coverage

The repository pins OIDF Conformance Suite commit
`dee9a25160e789f0f80517674693ef7989ab9fa1` (v5.2.0) and runs these upstream
plans:

- `oid4vci-1_0-issuer-test-plan`
- `oid4vci-1_0-issuer-haip-test-plan`
- `oid4vp-1final-verifier-test-plan`
- `oid4vp-1final-verifier-haip-test-plan`

The bounded registry is
[`tests/contracts/openid4vc-oidf-matrix.json`](../../tests/contracts/openid4vc-oidf-matrix.json).
It expands the plans into 17 executions covering both credential formats and
the supported security/transport axes. Management automation can only create
offers or presentation transactions; it cannot inspect protocol persistence,
so results are black-box evidence.

The upstream v5.2.0 suite has no modules for the unsupported combination
`mso_mdoc` + `redirect_uri` client identifier prefix + signed request URI +
`direct_post.jwt`; `mso_mdoc` encrypted-response coverage is therefore exercised
through the supported x509-prefixed signed-request variants instead.

The upstream plan display names explicitly call these tests **alpha** and say
they are incomplete/incorrect or not currently part of the certification
program. A green run is therefore official-suite regression evidence: it is
not an OpenID Foundation certification claim. No documentation or UI may use the
OpenID Certified mark on the basis of these runs.

Latest durable evidence:

- [2026-07-16 OpenID4VC Final / HAIP OIDF results](2026-07-16-openid4vc-final-oidf-results.md)
- Hostinger local official-suite run used `https://auth.nazo.run` as the tested
  production target and completed all 17 plan executions with zero failures.
- GitHub official run
  [#29530484889](https://github.com/nazozero/NazoAuth/actions/runs/29530484889)
  completed successfully against the same production origin.
