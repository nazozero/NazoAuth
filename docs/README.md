# Documentation

This directory groups durable project documentation by responsibility. Root
files and a few adjacent runbooks remain outside `docs/` when their location is
part of the repository interface, but they are indexed here so the full document
set can be scanned from one place.

### Support Text Files

These files are text artifacts but are not general reader documentation.

| File | Role |

| [../proptest-regressions/support/responses.txt](../proptest-regressions/support/responses.txt) | Proptest regression seed corpus. |

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep durable design, operations, protocol, security, conformance, coverage,
  performance, and project records under the matching `docs/` subdirectory.
- Keep user-facing repository entry points at the repository root when tools or
  hosting expect them there: `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and
  `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep benchmark runner instructions in `perf/README.md`; performance entry
  points and summaries belong under `docs/performance/`, while scenario
  reports belong under `docs/performance/reports/`.
- Keep maintained protocol regression contracts under `docs/conformance/`; link
  formal certification to its public register and exact certified version.
- Do not commit one-time task plans, finding ledgers, review transcripts, or
  completion/acceptance reports. Fold lasting behavior into its owning guide;
  keep run-specific evidence in CI artifacts or the associated issue/PR.
- Retain historical release notes and benchmark baselines only with a clear
  version/source and purpose. Benchmark claims must link retained raw results.
- Update affected guides, translations, indexes, source references, and
  specification inventory as applicable with every change, including code
  ownership and source-path changes that preserve external behavior.
- Keep generated lock files and regression seed corpora out of the reader-facing
  documentation flow; index them only as support artifacts.
