# Documentation

This directory groups durable project documentation by responsibility. Root
files and a few adjacent runbooks remain outside `docs/` when their location is
part of the repository interface, but they are indexed here so the full document
set can be scanned from one place.

### Support Text Files

These files are text artifacts but are not general reader documentation.

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |

| [../requirements/oidf-conformance.txt](../requirements/oidf-conformance.txt) | Generated Python dependency lock input for OIDF conformance tooling. |

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep durable design, operations, protocol, security, conformance, coverage,
  performance, and project records under the matching `docs/` subdirectory.
- Keep user-facing repository entry points at the repository root when tools or
  hosting expect them there: `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and
  `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep benchmark runner instructions in `perf/README.md`; performance entry
  points and summaries belong under `docs/performance/`, while scenario
  reports belong under `docs/performance/reports/`.
- Keep conformance run records under `docs/conformance/` and update
  [conformance/README.md](conformance/README.md) when adding new official or
  private suite evidence.
- Keep generated lock files and regression seed corpora out of the reader-facing
  documentation flow; index them only as support artifacts.
