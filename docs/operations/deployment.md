# Deployment Guide

NazoAuth has two explicit deployment contracts: Compose for source-based
development, and the signed `nazoauthctl` lifecycle for standalone Linux
production on Podman, Docker, or a host systemd service.

Both Direct TLS listeners support TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2. To satisfy FAPI 1
section 8.5, TLS 1.2 accepts only `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
and `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`. TLS 1.3 retains AES-GCM and
ChaCha20-Poly1305. An ECDSA server certificate therefore requires TLS 1.3;
deploy an RSA server certificate when TLS 1.2 clients must be supported.
For trusted-proxy deployments, configure the TLS terminator with the same
policy. This restriction applies to server authentication, not the key
algorithm of an OAuth client's mTLS certificate.

## Default and custom UI

The backend installs official NazoAuthWeb on first use and serves it at `/ui/`.
Its files live in `${DATA_DIR}/ui/current` (the `ui_data` volume in Compose). Replace
those files to update the frontend without rebuilding or restarting the backend;
existing UI files are preserved across backend upgrades. Keep the frontend
compatible with the API it calls. Use `UI_STATIC_DIR` for an existing custom UI,
or `UI_ENABLED=false` when hosting it independently or running APIs only.

## Source-tree development sandbox

Requirements:

- Docker Engine or another Compose-compatible container runtime;
- Docker Compose v2.

From the repository root:

```sh
export NAZOAUTH_POSTGRES_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-unique-runtime-password'
export NAZOAUTH_POSTGRES_LIFECYCLE_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-different-lifecycle-password'
export NAZOAUTH_SIGNING_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID='deployment-signing-root'
export NAZOAUTH_SIGNING_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=')"
export NAZOAUTH_VALKEY_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-unique-valkey-password'
export NAZOAUTH_VALKEY_STATE_EPOCH='replace-with-a-new-uuidv7'
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

Generate the signing-key wrapping root once and retain it with this database.
Reuse it when restarting the deployment.

Replace every placeholder before starting Compose. Passwords are embedded in
connection URLs, so restrict them to RFC 3986 unreserved characters
(`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`, `_`, and `~`). Use a distinct lifecycle
password: the lifecycle role owns migrations, while the server connects as the
non-superuser runtime role. Compose passes `DATABASE_URL` and `VALKEY_URL`
directly to NazoAuth; it does not create application-specific URL or password
files. The PostgreSQL image creates the runtime role only when initializing a
new `postgres_data` volume, so changing these variables does not rotate an
existing database's credentials.

To change both the host port and the public origin seen by browsers, keep the
variables above exported and run:

```sh
NAZOAUTH_PORT=443 \
NAZOAUTH_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 \
NAZOAUTH_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://auth.example.com \
NAZOAUTH_TRANSPORT_MODE=trusted-proxy \
NAZOAUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS=<exact-ingress-peer-cidr> \
NAZOAUTH_MTLS_CERTIFICATE_SOURCE=disabled \
docker compose up -d --build
```

This remains a source development sandbox, not a signed, attested Release
installation.

`NAZOAUTH_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` is required when a containerized Web IDE or
platform port mapper reaches the published host port through a non-loopback
interface. Keep the default `127.0.0.1` when a reverse proxy on the same host
terminates TLS. Do not bind all interfaces unless the platform or firewall
controls direct access to the plaintext port.

Compose maps `${NAZOAUTH_BIND_ADDRESS}:${NAZOAUTH_PORT}` on the host to the
server's container port `8000`. For example, `NAZOAUTH_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
NAZOAUTH_PORT=6987` publishes host port `6987` to container port `8000`. A host
port of `443` in this example is only a port mapping: with
`TRANSPORT_MODE=trusted-proxy`, TLS is still terminated by the reverse proxy,
not by NazoAuth. The long-running Compose server runs as the unprivileged
container user `10001:10001`; the root `runtime-init` service only prepares
volume ownership and must not be used as the server process.

Replace `<exact-ingress-peer-cidr>` with the address NazoAuth observes for the
TLS terminator. The Compose path is a trusted-proxy deployment; it does not
mount the server certificate and client-CA files required by direct TLS.

Compose starts PostgreSQL and Valkey with the explicitly supplied credentials,
runs migrations through the lifecycle PostgreSQL role, and then starts the
server with the separate runtime role. Migration startup depends only on
PostgreSQL; Valkey readiness is required only by the server.
With the unmodified loopback origin and port, open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` for dependency readiness
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/live` for process liveness
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/.well-known/openid-configuration`

All routes, including probes, resolve an active directory binding by Host.
If the issuer uses `auth.example.com`, a plaintext backend probe must retain
that host, for example:

```sh
curl --fail --header 'Host: auth.example.com' http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Replace the backend port with the published port. An IP-only request to a
hostname-bound deployment returns `404`; it does not select a default tenant.
For Direct TLS, use the issuer hostname in the URL so both SNI and Host match;
`curl --resolve auth.example.com:8443:127.0.0.1 https://auth.example.com:8443/health`
can test a local listener while retaining certificate verification.

The first source build requires network access to download Rust dependencies.
Later builds reuse the local container cache.

The default is a loopback-only evaluation deployment. PostgreSQL, Valkey, and
application state—including signing keys, avatars, generated application secrets,
administrator-provisioning receipts, and the UI release cache—use named volumes and survive
`docker compose down`. Do not use `docker compose down -v` unless deleting all
local data is intentional.

When the database has no administrator, the managed flow invokes the target's
local `nazoauth admin-provision` one-shot command through
`nazoauthctl admin create`. Credentials are delivered through the
controller's protected credential path; the authorization server exposes no
HTTP bootstrap route or embedded setup page.

## Standalone Direct TLS

For a standalone deployment without a reverse proxy, write the following to
`.env.yaml` in the server working directory and run `nazoauth server` as a
dedicated unprivileged service account. Replace the database and Valkey
placeholders and the example UUIDv7 with deployment values. The certificate
must cover `auth.example.com`; the private key must be readable by the service
account and be owner-only, or root-owned mode `0640` with the service's effective
group as its group owner. Keep all parent directories traversable by that group.

```yaml
BIND: "0.0.0.0:8443"
TLS_BIND: "0.0.0.0:9443"
PUBLIC_BASE_URL: "https://auth.example.com:8443"
MTLS_ENDPOINT_BASE_URL: "https://auth.example.com:9443"
TRANSPORT_MODE: "direct-tls"
MTLS_CERTIFICATE_SOURCE: "direct-tls"
TLS_CERTIFICATE_FILE: "/etc/nazoauth/tls/server-chain.pem"
TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE: "/etc/nazoauth/tls/server-key.pem"
TLS_CLIENT_CA_FILE: "/etc/nazoauth/tls/client-ca.pem"
TLS_RELOAD_INTERVAL_SECONDS: 5
DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://nazo_runtime:<password>@db.internal:5432/oauth"
VALKEY_URL: "redis://default:<password>@valkey.internal:6379/0"
VALKEY_STATE_EPOCH: "019c8ca2-30a6-7000-8000-00000000e102"
SIGNING_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID: "deployment-signing-root"
SIGNING_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE: "/run/secrets/signing-key-encryption-key"
DATA_DIR: "/var/lib/nazoauth"
RUST_LOG: "info"
```

Provision the referenced wrapping-root file once as an unpadded base64url
32-byte key and keep it with the matching database backups. Initialize schema
and tenant state through the signed managed lifecycle before starting the
runtime role; this listener example does not replace install or migration.

`BIND` and `TLS_BIND` use ports above 1024 so the long-running process does
not need root or `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`; the root account is only needed to
provision files and directories. If clients must reach direct TLS on public
port 443, use an external port forward to these high ports or choose the
trusted-proxy deployment instead. Do not run the server as root just to bind a
privileged port. In `direct-tls`, NazoAuth terminates both HTTPS listeners and
gets the mTLS identity from the TLS session. In `trusted-proxy`, the proxy
terminates public TLS and NazoAuth receives only sanitized, authenticated
certificate evidence over the internal HTTP hop; the two modes are mutually
exclusive.

For atomic identity rotation, point `TLS_CERTIFICATE_FILE` and
`TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` through the same operator-owned generation link, such as
`/etc/nazoauth/tls/current/server-chain.pem` and
`/etc/nazoauth/tls/current/server-key.pem`. The server preserves those link paths
and validates the new certificate/key pair on each reload interval. Relative
paths must remain inside the configuration directory when loaded.
`TLS_CLIENT_CA_FILE` is loaded at startup; changing the server identity does not
change the deployment's client CA trust.

## Public deployment

For a released production installation, use the supported lifecycle entry point:

```sh
nazoauthctl host add production-host --ssh production --privilege sudo
nazoauthctl install \
  --host production-host --name production \
  --runtime podman --public-url https://auth.example.com \
  --database-host db.internal --database-port 5432 \
  --database-name oauth \
  --database-runtime-user nazo_runtime \
  --database-runtime-password-file ./database-runtime-password \
  --database-lifecycle-user nazo_lifecycle \
  --database-lifecycle-password-file ./database-lifecycle-password \
  --valkey-host valkey.internal --valkey-port 6379 \
  --valkey-password-file ./valkey-password
nazoauthctl admin create --instance production
```

Select exactly one runtime: `podman`, `docker`, or `host`. The two PostgreSQL
roles and the Valkey credential must already exist; NazoAuthCtl does not create
credentials for external services. Administrator creation, controller binding,
and backup procedures are documented in
[one-click installation and updates](one-click-update.md).

`nazoauthctl` generates the private server configuration, deployment identity,
signing identity, application secrets, and recovery state. It binds NazoAuth
to the selected host loopback port. Put any
standards-compliant TLS reverse proxy in front of the deployment-specific
loopback endpoint. Read `runtime.loopback_port` from
`nazoauthctl --json status --instance production`; container port 8000 is not
the published host port. Configure `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` only for proxy
addresses you control, and keep `CLIENT_IP_HEADER_MODE=none` until the proxy
sanitizes forwarded headers correctly.

`NAZOAUTH_PORT` belongs to the source-tree Compose example; the managed
installer derives and records its own loopback port. `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` must
still match the public HTTPS address seen by clients.

### Reverse proxy and mTLS

When RFC 8705 client authentication is enabled, the TLS terminator must
request a client certificate and forward it with the RFC 9440 `Client-Cert`
header. NazoAuth authenticates the certificate against the client registration;
the proxy must not accept a `Client-Cert` or `Client-Cert-Chain` value supplied
by the Internet client. Configure `MTLS_CERTIFICATE_SOURCE=rfc9440` and set
`TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` to the exact address NazoAuth observes for that proxy. Do
not trust a whole container subnet when one host address is sufficient.

Use the reviewed HAProxy 3.2 boundary in
[`deploy/proxy/haproxy-rfc9440.cfg`](../../deploy/proxy/haproxy-rfc9440.cfg): it
separates ordinary HTTPS from a dedicated `verify required` mTLS listener,
strips all inbound forwarding and certificate headers, and adds only the
singleton RFC 9440 `Client-Cert` value derived from the verified TLS peer.

The leaf subject DN must differ from the CA subject DN, while its issuer DN must
match that CA. Include `openssl verify -CAfile run-ca.pem client.pem` in the
preflight; otherwise OpenSSL/HAProxy can classify a different-key leaf with the
same subject/issuer DN as self-signed and reject the handshake.

A client certificate must chain to the active bundle. NazoAuth still performs
the registration subject/SAN and optional certificate-digest checks. All of the
following must remain true:

- HAProxy deletes inbound certificate headers before adding its own value;
- the cleartext upstream is loopback-only or otherwise inaccessible to clients;
- NazoAuth trusts only the exact proxy address and validates the presented leaf
  against the registered certificate identity;
- TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are restricted separately to the approved AES-GCM suites.

For ordinary production clients issued by a stable CA, install that CA in
HAProxy and use `verify required` on a dedicated mTLS listener.

Before reloading HAProxy, validate the candidate with the same HAProxy image or
binary (`haproxy -c -f /path/to/candidate.cfg`) and retain a root-only copy of
the previous configuration. After reload, verify `/health`, Discovery,
anonymous rejection on the mTLS listener, an allowed AES-GCM handshake, and rejection of
CBC and CHACHA20. Roll back the saved configuration and reload immediately if
any check fails.

## Validation

Activation requires all of these checks:

1. `nazoauthctl status --instance production` reports the signed Release and content-addressed target;
2. `nazoauthctl doctor --instance production` reports current target status and diagnostic observations; verify database privileges and audit health through their owning checks;
3. `/health` returns HTTP 200;
4. `/.well-known/openid-configuration` returns the configured issuer;
5. the reverse proxy serves the same endpoints through the public HTTPS origin;
6. encrypted signing-key state, its wrapping root, and configured avatar storage
   remain available after a service restart.

Inspect the non-secret deployment state with:

```sh
nazoauthctl status --instance production
nazoauthctl operation --instance production --limit 20
```

## Upgrade and rollback

For a released standalone installation, the normal upgrade is:

```sh
nazoauthctl update --instance production
```

This verifies the tag-specific Sigstore identity and immutable artifact
digests, runs the signed migration and activation transaction, then checks
readiness and public Discovery. Configure a blocking backup gate explicitly:

```sh
nazoauthctl policy backup-before-update require --instance production \
  --max-age-seconds 86400
```

The gate refuses an update without the exact recent restore-tested snapshot.
If an irreversible migration has applied, artifact rollback is rejected and
the writer remains stopped until `nazoauthctl recover` restores a verified
snapshot. See
[One-click installation and updates](one-click-update.md).

Source deployments may still use Compose during development. They are not the
production update path. Database restoration remains separate because
migrations may be forward-only.

## Production boundaries

The bundled topology is a single-node deployment. Before relying on it for
production:

- back up the Compose database, Valkey state, and generated application secrets;
- retain the explicitly configured PostgreSQL and Valkey credentials in an
  appropriate secret manager;
- define backup and restore procedures;
- monitor PostgreSQL, Valkey, disk usage, and `/health`; use `/live` only for
  process restart decisions;
- keep encrypted keysets in durable storage, protect the wrapping root
  separately, and retain the configured avatar objects;
- use an external PostgreSQL/Valkey service or an orchestrator when HA is
  required;
- require the exact-commit security and conformance gates described in
  [release-security.md](release-security.md).

An intentional clean-data replacement is a new managed deployment, not an
in-place reset. Keep it separate from the existing deployment identity and
state epoch, and use the signed install/recovery lifecycle described in
[one-click installation and updates](one-click-update.md). Advanced settings
are documented in [configuration.md](configuration.md).
