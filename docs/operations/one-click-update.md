# Managed installation, update, and recovery

NazoAuthCtl manages NazoAuth through one current protocol lineage. A
controller uses its user-scoped Registry for host and instance inventory; the
target host's `DeploymentState` remains authoritative for runtime, artifact,
configuration, resources, journal, and backup facts. Supported persistence and
control-message formats are defined by the controller's
[compatibility contract](https://github.com/nazozero/NazoAuthCtl/blob/main/docs/compatibility.md).
Unknown or damaged state is preserved and rejected before mutation.

## Fresh installation

Register the target host first. SSH hosts use an existing OpenSSH Host alias;
the verified remote helper must be the exact same NazoAuthCtl build.

Installation requires a public issuer plus explicit facts for the external
PostgreSQL and Valkey services. Their credentials are read from bounded private
files and never accepted on argv. For example:

```sh
nazoauthctl install \
  --host production-host \
  --name production \
  --public-url https://auth.example.com \
  --to '<nazoauth-release-tag>' \
  --runtime podman \
  --database-host db.internal \
  --database-port 5432 \
  --database-name nazoauth \
  --database-runtime-user nazo_runtime \
  --database-runtime-password-file ./database-runtime-password \
  --database-lifecycle-user nazo_lifecycle \
  --database-lifecycle-password-file ./database-lifecycle-password \
  --valkey-host valkey.internal \
  --valkey-port 6379 \
  --valkey-password-file ./valkey-password
```

Replace `<nazoauth-release-tag>` with the required published, signed NazoAuth Release tag.

The command verifies the official Release and immutable runtime artifact,
creates a deployment-scoped non-nil UUIDv7 state epoch, writes the target
configuration and secrets with target-native paths, starts the runtime, checks
local health, commits `DeploymentState`, and only then registers the instance.
If an SSH response is lost, the prepared-install journal replays the exact same
deployment and operation IDs; it never creates a second deployment.

The runtime and lifecycle PostgreSQL roles must be distinct. The server receives
only the runtime URL; migration, backup, and recovery use the lifecycle role.
PostgreSQL and Valkey are external/shared resources. NazoAuthCtl records their
ownership boundary but does not create, replace, or delete them.

## Administrator provisioning and controller binding

Create the first administrator before binding the controller:

```sh
nazoauthctl admin create --instance production
```

Sign in at `https://auth.example.com/ui/auth` and enroll MFA. Then bind a
Controller Key using that administrator account and a fresh MFA code:

```sh
nazoauthctl bind --instance production --label operations \
  --output-secret-file ./production-recovery-secret
nazoauthctl verify --instance production
```

Administrator creation uses the target-local deployment authority and does not
require a Controller Key. Binding requires an existing administrator and fresh
MFA approval. The install receipt confirms local health; `verify` checks public
DNS, TLS, and OIDC separately.

The first bind also enrolls a Recovery Root. Store its Recovery Secret offline
before committing. If the commit is interrupted, the private pending record
retains the same proposal and secret until the outcome is reconciled.

Automation supplies a strict JSON object containing exactly `email` and
`password` through stdin:

```sh
printf '%s' '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"..."}' | \
  nazoauthctl admin create --instance production --credentials-stdin
```

The command invokes the target's local `nazoauth admin-provision` one-shot
command. Credentials are delivered through the controller's protected
credential path; they do not enter argv, ordinary environment variables,
Registry, or logs.

## Update and rollback

> [!WARNING]
> Check the target server's configuration and migration requirements before an
> update. Controller persistence has a separate compatibility contract: supported
> historical records remain readable, and inspection does not rewrite them.
> Keep a verified backup and matching recovery tools. Readable controller state
> does not establish that a server artifact or database migration can be rolled back.

```sh
nazoauthctl update --instance production --to '<nazoauth-release-tag>'
nazoauthctl rollback --instance production
```

Update resolves and verifies one immutable artifact, signs one canonical
`ControlOperation`, and executes migration before activation through the
target's journaled lifecycle operation. The durable `ControlResult` is bound to
the exact operation ID, request hash, typed payload, artifact target, and
configuration revision. A lost response replays the same operation; it does not
mint a parallel task.

Rollback uses recorded execution and schema facts; release-manifest schema 7
does not carry an asserted rollback policy. A pending applied migration fences
artifact rollback and leaves the writer stopped on activation failure. A
successful update that applied migrations clears the previous-artifact
reference, as does database recovery. Only updates without migration retain
the previous-artifact rollback path. Use `recover` with a verified snapshot
when artifact rollback is fenced; database rollback is never inferred from it.

## Backup and restore evidence

```sh
nazoauthctl backup snapshot --instance production
nazoauthctl backup restore-test --instance production
nazoauthctl policy backup-before-update require --instance production \
  --max-age-seconds 86400
nazoauthctl backup copy --instance production --to-host recovery-host
nazoauthctl backup show --instance production
```

A snapshot binds the PostgreSQL custom-format dump, deployment data, secrets,
configuration, runtime artifact digest, release version, schema, MFA/JWKS facts, and a
database sentinel in one immutable manifest. A restore test uses an isolated
database and runtime. `require` blocks update unless the exact restore-tested
manifest remains present and is no older than the configured maximum. Off-host
copy uses the registered execution target on each side, so a source or
destination may be local or SSH. The hosts must be distinct and byte-verified
receipts are recorded on both sides; same-host files do not count as off-host
evidence.

## Disaster recovery

```sh
nazoauthctl recover --instance production
```

If the restored Controller Registry rejects the current key with
`CONTROLLER_KEY_UNAUTHORIZED`, provide the offline secret through an owner-only
file:

```sh
nazoauthctl recover --instance production --recovery-secret-file ./recovery-secret
```

The secret is read only after that stable identity rejection. Network errors,
5xx responses, unknown outcomes, and other rejection codes never downgrade into
break-glass recovery.

Recovery quiesces the original runtime, restores the verified snapshot, starts
one loopback-only candidate, and performs the two Recovery Secret ceremony
requests through a process-owned target-local transport. The transport accepts only
`/controller-recovery/challenges` and `/controller-recovery/recover`, sends no
Cookie or CSRF header, and never exposes the candidate through public ingress.

The recovered controller signs `RecoveryInvalidate` with the new UUIDv7 Valkey
state epoch. NazoAuth revokes refresh tokens and returns an absolute
`not_before` deadline covering the maximum access/ID token TTL plus skew. Both
the controller and target host enforce the deadline while the original runtime
remains stopped. Only then does the target replace and start the original
runtime from the restored artifact/config/data and remove the exact candidate.
Any failure remains fail-closed and resumes from the persisted phase.

After an irreversible migration, `rollback` is rejected. Resume only through
the persisted `recover` transaction and its verified snapshot; do not restart a
writer manually or flush shared Valkey.

## Trust boundary

Release bytes, attestations, Sigstore identity, manifest metadata, and the OCI
digest are verified before activation. The application independently validates
the signed ControlOperation against the executing binary or image digest, while
NazoAuthCtl observes the same content identity from the runtime.

The controller's Release verifier accepts only a public non-draft Release. It
uses bounded `curl` requests and verifies Sigstore bundles with host `cosign`
or its pinned Podman/Docker fallback. A missing verification tool is an error,
not permission to consume an unattested artifact. Runtime, SSH and database
operations have their own target prerequisites; consult the controller's
[development guide](https://github.com/nazozero/NazoAuthCtl/blob/main/docs/development.md).

Use `nazoauthctl --help` and subcommand help as the only command-surface
authority. This document describes the current v0.2 model only.
