# Release Platform Support

## What the Release Matrix Proves

The tagged Release workflow builds and executes the server binary on a native runner
with the same operating system and CPU architecture as the target. It does not
label a cross-compiled file as supported without executing it. Every matrix
entry executes `nazoauth` and checks its `release-identity` JSON against the
release tag and operator protocol version.

| Rust target | Native runner | GitHub Release assets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64 | `nazoauth-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Ubuntu 24.04 Arm64 | `nazoauth-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` | Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64 | `nazoauth-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` | Ubuntu 24.04 Arm64 | `nazoauth-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | Windows 2025 x86-64 | `nazoauth-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` |
| `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` | Windows 11 Arm64 | `nazoauth-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` | macOS 15 Intel | `nazoauth-x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | macOS 15 Apple Silicon | `nazoauth-aarch64-apple-darwin` |

The GNU binaries inherit the glibc baseline of Ubuntu 24.04. Use the matching
musl artifact for older or heterogeneous Linux userspace. The workflow rejects
musl binaries with dynamic dependencies and rejects every desktop or GNU binary
that dynamically loads libpq, libssl, or libcrypto. Normal operating-system
libraries and frameworks remain platform dependencies.

The container Release is a single OCI index at
`ghcr.io/nazozero/nazoauth:<version>` containing exactly `linux/amd64` and
`linux/arm64`. The workflow scans an OCI archive first, publishes that exact
archive without rebuilding, and records the index and both platform-manifest
digests.

## Product and Controller Boundaries

`nazoauth` is the portable application executable. `nazoauthctl` has its own
native matrix and Release in `nazozero/NazoAuthCtl`. Managed lifecycle capability is negotiated with the target helper. Current clean
install accepts Linux and Windows target path models, then selects only a
runtime advertised by that helper. Podman/Docker require a usable engine;
`host` is the Linux systemd backend. Direct TLS clean install currently requires
a Linux Podman or Docker target. macOS is not an accepted clean-install target.
Native binary smoke and unit tests do not establish an end-to-end lifecycle,
mount, permission, or recovery guarantee on any target; retain target-specific
execution evidence. The controller repository owns this qualification boundary.

On Linux x86-64, the controller selects the x86-64 GNU or musl Release artifact
and binds container operations to the signed `linux/amd64` platform-manifest
digest. On Linux Arm64 it selects the corresponding `aarch64` artifact and
binds container operations to `linux/arm64`. Host paths and systemd units are
architecture-neutral; the signed target-specific binary digest remains the
authority for install and every later update.

NazoAuth provides APIs and an optional static UI host. On first use it installs
the latest official NazoAuthWeb release into `${DATA_DIR}/ui/current` and serves `/ui/`.
Existing files are reused without a frontend version pin. Frontend files may be
replaced while the server is running; backend and controller releases do not
overwrite them. Set `UI_STATIC_DIR` for a different directory or `UI_ENABLED=false`
when another web server hosts the UI or no UI is required.

## Server and Protocol GitHub Releases

Persistent GitHub Release assets contain exactly the 8 platform-suffixed server
executables in the table and the matching
`nazo-operator-protocol-<version>.crate`. The crate is produced once from the
unique protocol source, package-verified, digest-checked, and given standard
build provenance before publication. Manifests, signatures, checksum files,
SBOMs, OCI archives, bootstrap scripts, and other JSON or tar files are not
Release assets. Supply-chain evidence remains in GitHub Actions, GitHub artifact
attestations, Sigstore, and the signed GHCR image.

Each executable has a custom GitHub attestation with predicate type
`https://nazo.run/attestations/release-manifest/v1`. Its closed schema binds the
target, server executable digest, operator protocol version,
OCI index and platform manifests. Verify a downloaded
file before execution:

```sh
version=v1.2.3
gh attestation verify ./nazoauth-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl \
  --repo nazozero/NazoAuth \
  --predicate-type https://nazo.run/attestations/release-manifest/v1 \
  --signer-workflow nazozero/NazoAuth/.github/workflows/release-security.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$version" \
  --deny-self-hosted-runners
```

Digest verification proves the downloaded subject; the predicate then provides
the Release metadata bound to that subject. Do not substitute an artifact from
another target merely because its file name is similar.
