# Composable Capability Policy

## Why capabilities are not one exclusive profile

NazoAuth separates three independent questions:

1. **Server support**: is the endpoint, protocol handler, and operational
   dependency available?
2. **Client authority**: may this client use the capability?
3. **Assurance and message protection**: which additional security invariants
   must this client satisfy?

Server support is therefore not equivalent to client authorization. Stable,
non-conflicting handlers can be active together while client grant allowlists
and `security_policy` continue to deny use by default.

Every client carries an explicit versioned `security_policy`. A missing policy
is rejected; no global process setting reconstructs or substitutes one.

## New-install server defaults

The following stable runtime modules are enabled on a new database:

| Module | Why server support is safe to enable | Client-side authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Request Objects / JAR | Signed input is validated; unsigned JAR remains forbidden | Optional request, or `require_signed_authorization_request` |
| JARM | Adds a protected response form without removing baseline responses | `require_signed_authorization_response` or explicit `response_mode=jwt` |
| Device Authorization Grant | Endpoint availability does not grant a client the flow | Device grant allowlist **and** `allow_cross_device_flows=true` |
| CIBA poll/ping | Poll and ping coexist; push remains unsupported | CIBA grant/metadata **and** `allow_cross_device_flows=true` |
| Token Exchange | The implementation is a bounded local-token profile | Client grant allowlist and existing target/scope checks |
| JWT Bearer Grant | The implemented profile remains client-bound | Client grant allowlist and client authentication |
| SCIM | Server role can coexist with OAuth/OIDC roles | SCIM bearer authority and scope checks |
| Front-Channel Logout | Endpoint support does not register an RP logout URI | Registered client logout metadata |
| Session Management | The iframe can coexist with logout and OIDC | `session_management=true` |

The following modules are enabled only when their real prerequisite exists:

| Module | Prerequisite |
| --- | --- |
| Dynamic Client Registration | A non-empty `DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_INITIAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| Rich Authorization Requests | Explicit RAR deployment configuration |
| SCIM Security Events | Receiver/event configuration |
| OpenID4VCI / OpenID4VP | Complete role, credential, and trust configuration |
| Native SSO | Explicit draft-profile opt-in; Token Exchange is enabled as a dependency |
| FAPI HTTP Signatures | Explicit experimental opt-in |

Draft, experimental, remote-trust, and debug behavior remains default-off.
Implicit, hybrid, Resource Owner Password Credentials, unsigned Request
Objects, query bearer tokens, and CIBA push are not optional capabilities and
cannot be enabled.

## Versioned per-client policy

Admin-created clients receive this default policy:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "assurance": "baseline",
  "require_signed_authorization_request": false,
  "require_signed_authorization_response": false,
  "require_signed_introspection_response": false,
  "session_management": false,
  "allow_cross_device_flows": false,
  "allow_confidential_oidc_without_pkce": false
}
```

RFC 7591 registration also materializes the baseline policy and cannot
self-assign FAPI, session, or cross-device authority. An administrator may
compose compatible controls, for example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "assurance": "fapi2",
  "require_signed_authorization_request": true,
  "require_signed_authorization_response": true,
  "require_signed_introspection_response": true,
  "session_management": true,
  "allow_cross_device_flows": true,
  "allow_confidential_oidc_without_pkce": false
}
```

`allow_confidential_oidc_without_pkce` defaults to false. Only a controlled
baseline confidential OIDC compatibility boundary may set it; FAPI and
sender-constrained authorization still require S256. The DCR application sets
this exception for its supported confidential OIDC registration profile.

These fields are independent. FAPI2 assurance enforces confidential client
type, strong client authentication, PAR, S256 PKCE, sender-constrained tokens,
and the FAPI authorization-code lifetime. It does not prevent JAR, JARM, signed
introspection, CIBA, Device Grant, or Session Management from being selected at
the same time.

Registration validation fails closed when an explicit policy cannot be
satisfied. For example, FAPI2 without DPoP or mTLS is rejected, and mandatory
signed authorization requests require a registered signing-key source.
Unknown policy versions and fields are rejected.

Sender constraints are independent of the authorization request channel.
`require_dpop_bound_tokens` and `require_mtls_bound_tokens` constrain token
issuance and PKCE strength at the authorization endpoint; they never force a
baseline client into PAR or JAR. Only the explicit FAPI2 assurance profile and
the explicit `require_signed_authorization_request` flag select the
signed/pushed request channel.

## Upgrade behavior

Runtime desired state and client policy are explicit persisted authorities.

- On a **new database**, the composable defaults above are seeded.
- On an **existing database**, every catalog module must already have exactly
  one explicit `enabled` or `disabled` desired row. Missing rows and `inherit`
  stop migration instead of guessing the deployment's prior configuration.
- Every existing client must already have an explicit, valid version-1
  `security_policy`. A missing policy stops migration; the global
  `AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_PROFILE` is never used to infer per-client state.
- Any newly created client receives an explicit version-1 baseline policy.

After migration, runtime module administration is the only authority. The
default-policy table, `inherit`, and the removed stable-module `ENABLE_*` flags
do not exist as runtime inputs.

## Discovery semantics

Discovery publishes the union of currently active server capabilities.
Discovery does not claim that every registered client may use every published
feature. The authenticated request is still checked against the client's grant
allowlist, metadata, sender constraints, and `security_policy`.
