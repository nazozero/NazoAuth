# SCIM 2.0 Provisioning

## Scope

SCIM support is a default-tenant provisioning surface with database-backed SCIM
credentials. It is an identity-platform feature, not part of OAuth/OIDC or FAPI
conformance.

## Configuration

Preferred configuration uses rows in `scim_tokens`:

- Store only `blake3` hex in `token_hash`.
- Bind the credential to a `tenant_id`.
- Set `scopes` to an array containing `scim:read`, `scim:write`, or `scim:*`.
- Event receivers require the dedicated `scim:events` scope and a non-empty
  `event_audience` identifying the SET recipient. Do not grant this scope to
  ordinary provisioning credentials.
- Use `expires_at` for planned rotation windows.
- Set `revoked_at` to retire a credential.
- Use `label` for operator-facing rotation notes; do not store the raw token.

SCIM authorization accepts only hashed database credentials. Each credential has
an explicit tenant, scope set, expiry/revocation lifecycle, last-use timestamp,
and audit identity. A global environment-backed full-access bearer token is not
implemented by security policy.

RFC 9967 delivery is default-closed. Set `ENABLE_SCIM_SECURITY_EVENTS=true` to
admit new events and advertise supported event URIs. `SCIM_EVENT_RETENTION_SECONDS`
defaults to 604800 (7 days) and accepts 3600 through 2592000 (30 days).

Credential behavior:

- Raw SCIM bearer tokens are not stored in the database.
- Multiple database tokens are valid at the same time during rotation windows.
- Database tokens can expire or be revoked independently.
- Read endpoints require `scim:read` or `scim:*`.
- Create, replace, patch, and delete endpoints require `scim:write` or `scim:*`.
- Successful database-token use updates `last_used_at` and inserts `scim_audit_events`.
- Successful and denied SCIM token checks emit structured audit events without raw token material.
- `nazo_oauth_migrate` runs `nazo_oauth_cleanup_expired_security_state()`, which
  removes SCIM audit events older than 180 days together with expired security
  state. This keeps audit retention bounded while preserving a compromise
  investigation window.

Outside default SCIM:

- OAuth client-credentials or introspection-backed SCIM authorization.
- Per-tenant SCIM credential routing. The schema stores `tenant_id`; provisioning uses the default tenant boundary.

## Endpoints

- `GET /scim/v2/ServiceProviderConfig`
- `GET /scim/v2/Schemas`
- `GET /scim/v2/ResourceTypes`
- `GET /scim/v2/Users`
- `POST /scim/v2/Users`
- `GET /scim/v2/Users/{user_id}`
- `PUT /scim/v2/Users/{user_id}`
- `PATCH /scim/v2/Users/{user_id}`
- `DELETE /scim/v2/Users/{user_id}`
- `POST /scim/v2/SecurityEvents` (RFC 8936 poll delivery, when enabled)

`DELETE` is a soft delete: it sets `active=false` and keeps the user record for audit and token-revocation continuity.

## Identity Mapping

SCIM `userName` maps to the local `users.email` login identifier. The primary
email must match `userName`; create, replace, and patch requests that split
these identities are rejected.

Provisioned users are created in the default tenant, realm, and organization. A
deployment with request-level tenant routing must select the tenant boundary
before creating, listing, updating, or deleting users.

## Supported Operations

Listing supports both index and RFC 9865 forward cursor pagination and supports
only `userName eq "email@example.com"` filters.

- Index pagination remains the default and accepts `startIndex` plus `count`.
- Cursor pagination is selected by an empty first-page `cursor` parameter and
  returns `nextCursor` on every non-final page.
- Cursor pages are ordered by `(created_at, id)` and do not return
  `startIndex` or the optional `previousCursor`.
- Cursors are stateless AES-256-GCM values with a fresh nonce, a domain-separated
  key derived from the stable client-secret pepper, and a 600-second lifetime.
- Each cursor is bound to the SCIM credential, tenant, exact filter, effective
  count, ordering policy, and last row. Every page repeats bearer, scope, and
  tenant authorization.
- Bearer authorization runs before raw query parsing. Malformed or duplicate
  pagination fields therefore retain the SCIM error envelope instead of being
  rejected by the framework's generic query extractor.
- Invalid or substituted cursors use `invalidCursor`, authenticated expired
  cursors use `expiredCursor`, and count changes use `invalidCount`.
- Results are a live ordered set rather than a database snapshot: later inserts
  after the marker may appear, deletes may reduce the remaining set, and an
  already returned unchanged row is not repeated.

`/ServiceProviderConfig` advertises the SCIM pagination and event capability
boundary explicitly:

- RFC 9865 cursor pagination and index pagination are supported; index remains
  `defaultPaginationMethod`, `cursorTimeout` is 600, and the maximum page size
  is 200.
- The default page size is 100 and the maximum page size is 200.
- RFC 9967 provisioning SETs are advertised only while the security-event
  module can accept new mutations. Asynchronous SCIM requests remain unsupported,
  so `securityEvents.asyncRequest` stays `none`.

## RFC 9967 Security Event Tokens

When enabled, successful create, replace, patch, activate, and deactivate
mutations write a minimal notice event to a PostgreSQL outbox in the same
transaction as the user change. Soft `DELETE` emits `prov:deactivate`, not the
hard-delete event. NazoAuth does not advertise `prov:delete` because it has no
hard-delete operation.

Receivers poll `POST /scim/v2/SecurityEvents` using RFC 8936 request fields
`maxEvents`, `returnImmediately`, `ack`, and `setErrs`. `maxEvents` defaults to
20 and is capped at 100. A request containing `setErrs` must send
`Content-Language`. Empty long polls wait for at most 30 seconds. Delivery is
at least once: an event remains visible to a receiver until that receiver
acknowledges it or reports a terminal error. Receipts are isolated by SCIM
token, so one receiver cannot consume another receiver's copy. A newly created
receiver begins at its credential creation time and cannot read older events.

Each SET is signed only when delivered, uses `typ=secevent+jwt`, and contains
`iss`, `iat`, `jti`, `txn`, receiver-bound `aud`, SCIM `sub_id`, and the RFC 9967
`events` object. No `sub`, `exp`, password, email value, display name, or full
SCIM resource is included. Event rows expire under the configured retention
window and are removed by `nazo_oauth_cleanup_expired_security_state()`.

Production deployments must expose the endpoint through HTTPS. Operators own
receiver credential rotation, audience coordination, monitoring of terminal
SET errors, and polling capacity. Disabling the event module stops creation and
advertisement immediately; the runtime drain window continues serving already
stored events for up to the configured retention period.

PATCH supports `replace` for:

- `userName`
- `active`
- `name.formatted`
- `name.givenName`
- `name.familyName`
- `emails`

Bulk operations, sorting, password changes, groups, and SCIM enterprise-user
extensions are not advertised.
