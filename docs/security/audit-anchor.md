# External audit-ledger anchoring

Committed security events enter the append-only `security_audit_events`
ledger and its durable outbox. Application emission is not always synchronous;
see [Security Events](security-events.md) for queue loss, required append, and
transactional producer boundaries. An independent `nazoauth audit-anchor-worker`
(or equivalent sidecar) claims that outbox in bounded batches and sends one
checkpoint per event to `AUDIT_ANCHOR_URL` over HTTPS. The exporter assigns
sequence and BLAKE3 hashes to committed events in immutable
`security_audit_chain_entries`, atomically with its bounded outbox claim. A
business transaction writes the event and outbox without locking the global
chain head. Retries reuse the assigned chain entry. The server process does
not run this exporter and does not receive its database role or sink secret.

The hash chain and its sequence belong to the deployment. HTTP security events
capture `payload.tenant_id` from the same immutable tenant context that routes
the request, before the event enters the shared writer queue. Concurrent
requests cannot exchange this context, and a conflicting tenant field is
rejected. Tenant-resource management events bind their tenant in the signed
operation and database transaction. Deployment events outside a tenant request
do not inherit the last request's identity.

Each request contains the checkpoint schema `nazo.audit.anchor.v1` and these
fields:

* `event_id` (also the `Idempotency-Key`);
* `deployment_id`, `sequence`, `previous_hash`, and `event_hash`;
* `event_type`, `event_category`, `payload`, and `occurred_at`.

The signed body is immutable for a given outbox row. The delivery timestamp is
carried separately in `X-Nazo-Audit-Sent-At`, so retries reuse the same body,
signature, and idempotency key. The empty ledger uses a stable
`genesis:<deployment_id>` idempotency key and an explicit `checkpoint_kind` of
`genesis`.

The receiver must recompute the BLAKE3 event hash before accepting a
checkpoint. The hash input is `nazo.audit.v1\0`, big-endian sequence, previous
hash, UUID bytes, length-prefixed UTF-8 event type and category, big-endian
microsecond timestamp, and length-prefixed PostgreSQL `jsonb::text` payload.
Sequence and timestamp are signed 64-bit integers; lengths are unsigned 64-bit
byte counts, all big-endian. Hashes are 32 raw bytes and the event UUID is 16 raw
bytes. The JSON wire envelope encodes hashes as unpadded base64url. A receiver
must reproduce PostgreSQL `jsonb::text` representation, including whitespace
and key ordering; hashing arbitrary reserialized JSON is not equivalent.
The [ledger adapter](../../crates/persistence-postgres/src/repositories/audit_ledger.rs)
owns this encoding. The receiver independently validates deployment identity,
sequence continuity, previous hash, event content, and duplicate consistency.

The worker authenticates the exact JSON body with HMAC-SHA-256 in
`X-Nazo-Audit-Signature: sha256=<base64url>` (unpadded). The separate
`X-Nazo-Audit-Sent-At` header is not covered by this MAC. Only a 2xx response acknowledges
the outbox row; an idempotent receiver must return 2xx for a replay rather than
an ambiguous conflict response. Acknowledgement deletes the delivery row in the
same transaction that advances the anchor checkpoint — the accepted checkpoint
and the immutable event/chain records are the durable evidence, so no delivered
row is retained and no separate sweeper reclaims it.
Transport and non-success responses are rescheduled from one second up to
300 seconds with exponential backoff. Claim, acknowledgement, and rescheduling
are fenced by the expected delivery attempt, so an expired claimant cannot
advance a newer claim. The response body is never logged, and the HMAC secret is never
included in logs or the checkpoint.

This is shared-secret authentication, not a non-repudiable signature. The worker
does not validate a signed receiver receipt; it records the receiver's HTTP
acceptance. An idempotent receiver must persist before returning success and
reject a duplicate identity whose contents differ. Empty-ledger genesis uses
the nil UUID, sequence zero, identical previous/event hashes, and Unix epoch
time; it is a checkpoint, not a fabricated security event.

The worker records its observation and every externally accepted checkpoint in the shared audit chain state. Event acknowledgement and checkpoint advancement are one database operation. In `AUDIT_ANCHOR_MODE=required`, high-impact management preflight requires a recent worker observation, a valid deployment checkpoint, and oldest pending event age within `AUDIT_ANCHOR_MAX_LAG_SECONDS`. A bounded backlog is allowed, including committed events not yet chained. With no backlog the checkpoint must equal the chain head; historical delivery latency does not keep a recovered deployment unavailable. An empty ledger records its signed, externally accepted genesis checkpoint before required mode becomes ready. No instance-local health file is used.
`optional` and `disabled` do not read exporter health on management admission;
the durable writer availability check still applies. `disabled` is an explicit
development setting and provides no protection against a privileged local
attacker.

Delivery is deliberately strict and ordered: a permanently rejected earliest
checkpoint blocks later checkpoints. Operators must alert on `audit.anchor`
retries and repair the receiver contract or credentials. There is no skip/DLQ
operation because skipping would make a later external chain look complete
when it is not.

Recommended production separation:

* pre-create distinct lifecycle, server-writer, and exporter database roles;
* for a source-managed deployment, run `nazoauth migrate` with the lifecycle database URL and
  `NAZOAUTH_MIGRATION_RUNTIME_ROLE` naming the server-writer role; migration
  resets that role's direct `public` schema/table/sequence privileges, grants
  application DML, and grants only ledger append/check-availability functions;
* give the worker exporter role only chain assignment and outbox claim/ack/health rights;
* provide the worker `AUDIT_ANCHOR_DATABASE_URL` and `AUDIT_ANCHOR_TOKEN` (or
  its secret-file form), while the server receives only the deployment identity;
* use the [ledger role provisioning runbook](../operations/security-audit-ledger-roles.md)
  for grants and the managed operator-task migration boundary;
* protect the HTTPS receiver with append-only/WORM retention and verify its
  idempotency behavior independently.

This repository contains the worker protocol and shared database preflight logic;
it does not prove a deployed receiver's WORM guarantees, cross-host
availability, or real external acceptance.  Those require a deployment-level
probe and an independent receiver audit.

Database provisioning remains responsible for database `CONNECT`, removal of
`PUBLIC` schema `CREATE` and database temporary-table rights, and the exporter
function grants. Those are database-wide trust decisions and are not silently
changed by an application migration.

## Configuration

The [configuration loader](../../crates/nazoauth/src/adapters/audit_anchor/config.rs)
is the authority for accepted values. Secret-file forms follow the normal
[configuration precedence](../operations/configuration.md).

| Setting | Default / requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_MODE` | `disabled`; worker requires `optional` or `required`. |
| `DEPLOYMENT_ID` | Required in enabled modes; 1–255 ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `-`, or `_`. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_FRESHNESS_SECONDS` | 120; positive in enabled modes. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_MAX_LAG_SECONDS` | 300; positive in enabled modes. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_URL` | Worker-only HTTPS URL without credentials, query, or fragment; redirects are disabled. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_TOKEN` | Worker-only HMAC secret, at least 16 bytes. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_DATABASE_URL` | Worker-only exporter-role database URL. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | 4; positive. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | 5; positive. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 10; positive. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_BATCH_SIZE` | 64; range 1–256. |
| `AUDIT_ANCHOR_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 60; range 1–3600. |

The server receives the preflight settings and deployment identity, never the
worker database URL or sink token. Required mode rejects stale/future worker
observations, a mismatched deployment, invalid checkpoints, or excessive oldest
pending age. It gates callers of management preflight; it is not a promise that
every HTTP response waits for its own external checkpoint.

After database restore, reconcile the local chain and outbox with the receiver's
already accepted deployment sequence before resuming export. Do not erase the
receiver's history or reset deployment identity merely to make a fork appear
continuous. Database ownership can rewrite unanchored local state; only
independently protected receiver history survives that boundary.
