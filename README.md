Nazo Auth Server is a self-hosted OAuth 2.x / OAuth 2.1-aligned and OpenID
Connect authorization server written in Rust. It is built for same-origin
deployments where the issuer, browser UI, passkeys, CORS, cookies, and protocol
endpoints share one public origin.

The project includes the authorization server, a compact identity/admin surface,
local signing key management, WebAuthn/passkeys, MFA, SCIM, and Rust
resource-server verification libraries. Modular external-provider login is
tracked in the future roadmap rather than advertised as a current default
capability. It uses PostgreSQL for durable state and Valkey for short-lived
protocol state.

## OpenAI Build Week 2026

NazoAuth predates OpenAI Build Week. The hackathon submission covers only the
work completed after the submission period opened at
`2026-07-13T16:00:00Z`. The last pre-period commit is
[`ef7df3e`](https://github.com/nazozero/NazoAuth/commit/ef7df3e4606953002bb768a66a1897a06b42a332),
and the complete review range is
[`ef7df3e..main`](https://github.com/nazozero/NazoAuth/compare/ef7df3e4606953002bb768a66a1897a06b42a332...main).

During the submission period, Codex with GPT-5.6 helped turn the existing
server into a modular Rust workspace, implement OpenID4VC Final issuer and
verifier roles, add FAPI-CIBA mTLS/ping and RFC 9967 SCIM security-event
delivery, harden the browser client and onboarding flow, and make the official
OIDF suites exercise the public production service as a black box. Codex
accelerated repository audits, implementation, tests, specification
cross-checks, CI diagnosis, and deployment verification. The maintainer chose
the product and security boundaries, required standards-first behavior instead
of suite-specific shortcuts, reviewed the changes, and controlled deployment
and merge decisions.

See the [Build Week engineering record](docs/project/openai-build-week-2026.md)
for the before/after boundary, dated pull requests, measured change volume,
Codex collaboration details, setup instructions, and a no-rebuild public test
path. The live demo is available at <https://auth.nazo.run/ui/auth>.

## Status

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Package | `nazo-oauth-server` |
| Version | `0.1.0` |
| License | AGPL-3.0-or-later |
| Language | Rust 2024 |
| Runtime services | PostgreSQL, Valkey |
| Conformance test issuer | operator-provided public HTTPS origin |

## Quality Signals

Project quality is tracked through direct, auditable checks rather than a
composite score:

| Signal | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Rust quality gate | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, migrations, and the complete workspace test suite in `code-quality`. |
| Static security analysis | CodeQL Rust analysis with the `security-extended` query suite. |
| Dependency policy | GitHub dependency review, `cargo audit`, and `cargo deny` over advisories, bans, licenses, and sources. |
| Runtime security behavior | Real HTTP E2E, load/race gate, and Valkey outage injection in `conformance-security`. |
| Protocol conformance | Public black-box official-suite evidence for the current 25-plan OIDF/FAPI matrix and 17-plan OpenID4VC matrix. |
| Coverage trend | Codecov LCOV upload from the dedicated coverage workflow. |
| Release provenance | CycloneDX SBOM, Trivy image scan, Sigstore signing, and GitHub artifact attestations. |

## Features

- Authorization code + PKCE, refresh tokens, client credentials, bounded JWT
  bearer grant, bounded Token Exchange, revocation, introspection,
  signed/encrypted introspection, discovery, protected resource metadata, JWKS,
  JSON/signed/encrypted UserInfo, signed/encrypted JARM, PAR, JAR, DPoP, and
  mTLS.
- Runtime profiles: `oauth2-baseline`, `fapi2-security`,
  `fapi2-message-signing-authz-request`, `fapi2-message-signing-jarm`, and
  `fapi2-message-signing-introspection`.
- Local users, profiles, OAuth clients, grants, access requests, TOTP MFA,
  backup codes, remembered MFA, WebAuthn/passkeys, and SCIM provisioning.
- Local signing key lifecycle with prepublish, active, grace, and retired
  states. External-command signing is available for KMS/HSM integrations.
- Framework-independent Rust resource-server verifier plus the project's Actix
  HTTP integration. Historical Axum/Tower and tonic adapters are not shipped.
- Release security workflows for CodeQL, dependency review, cargo audit,
  cargo deny, SBOM generation, Trivy image scanning, keyless signing, and
  provenance attestations.

## Quick start

Requirements:

- The exact Rust stable version pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`
- PostgreSQL 18 or a compatible PostgreSQL server
- Valkey 8 or a compatible Redis protocol server
- Container runtime for the optional integration stack

Run with Docker Compose:

```sh
cp .env.yaml.example .env.yaml
docker compose up -d nazo_oauth_server
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

On the first direct server run, NazoAuth creates `.env.yaml` and exits. Review
the generated file, point it at reachable PostgreSQL and Valkey services, then
run migrations and start the server:

```sh
cargo run --bin nazoauth -- server
# Edit .env.yaml before continuing.
cargo run --bin nazoauth -- migrate
cargo run --bin nazoauth -- server
```

## Configuration

Configuration is intentionally small for new deployments:

```yaml
BIND: "0.0.0.0:8000"
PUBLIC_BASE_URL: "https://auth.example.com"
DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://nazo_oauth:<password>@postgres:5432/oauth"
VALKEY_URL: "redis://valkey:6379/0"
DATA_DIR: "/var/lib/nazo_oauth"
AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_PROFILE: "oauth2-baseline"
RUST_LOG: "info"
```

`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` drives the same-origin defaults:

| Value | Default rule |
| --- | --- |
| `ISSUER` | `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` |
| `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` | `PUBLIC_BASE_URL + "/ui/"` |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | origin of `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` for HTTPS issuers |
| `PASSKEY_ORIGIN` and `PASSKEY_RP_ID` | derived from issuer |
| `PROTECTED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER` | `ISSUER + "/fapi/resource"` |

`DATA_DIR` drives persistent local file paths:

| Value | Default rule |
| --- | --- |
| `JWK_KEYS_DIR` | `DATA_DIR + "/keys"` |
| `AVATAR_STORAGE_DIR` | `DATA_DIR + "/avatars"` |

Advanced settings cover specialized deployments.
They are documented in [docs/operations/configuration.md](docs/operations/configuration.md).

## Default boundaries

The following capabilities are outside the default authorization-server surface
and are not advertised unless implemented, tested, and explicitly enabled:

- Dynamic Client Registration / RFC 7591 and Client Configuration Management
  / RFC 7592 unless `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_CLIENT_REGISTRATION=true`; public
  registration deployments should protect `/register` with an initial access
  token.
- Device Authorization Grant / RFC 8628 unless `ENABLE_DEVICE_AUTHORIZATION_GRANT=true`.
- External-token, refresh-token, or ID-token Token Exchange profiles.
- Modular third-party login providers such as QQ, WeChat, Google, Microsoft, or
  enterprise SAML; these are roadmap items until provider-specific adapters,
  configuration gates, account linking, and E2E/negative tests exist.
- Request-level dynamic tenant or issuer routing.
- RFC 9701 encrypted introspection responses outside the signed-introspection
  profile, or without per-client JWE response metadata.
- UserInfo or JARM encryption without supported per-client JWE metadata and a
  unique matching public encryption key.

See [docs/project/roadmap.md](docs/project/roadmap.md) for the current scope record.
